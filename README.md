# DockerNodeMongo 

This is a Docker starter template that will get you setup with a barebones development template for a Node / Express / Mongo app. 

### Requirements
You'll need to have docker, docker-compose, and docker-machine or an equivalent installed on your computer. 

### Installation and Boot Up
`git clone` the repo, `cd` into the repo, and then run `docker-compose up` to start the docker instance. 

Once `docker-compose` is up and running, navigate your browser to `localhost:3000` and you should see your app's "Hello world"

### Notes 
The container uses Nodemon, so any changes in your code will restart the server in the docker container.
