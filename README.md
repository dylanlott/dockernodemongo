# DockerNodeMongo 

This is a Docker starter template that will get you setup with a barebones development template for a Node / Express / Mongo app. 

`git clone` the repo, `cd` into the repo, and then run `docker-compose up` to start the docker instance. 

Once `docker-compose` is up and running, navigate your browser to `localhost:3000` and you should see your app's "Hello world"

The container uses Nodemon, so any changes in your code will restart the server in the docker container.
